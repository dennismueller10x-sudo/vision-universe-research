# Execution ledger

## Run identity
- Base SHA / initially observed main: 533245e8bb1b805c24c1ce9ba2051345ad215e24.
- Started: 2026-09-09 (initial sync; exact original wall-clock not retained).
- Branch: workstream/vu2-phase0-audit. Separate read-only review worktree: ../vu2-lifecycle-review.
- Current phase: 0 documentation gate; product files unchanged.
- Shared contracts: schema.js, query.js, display-policy.js, market-store.js, metric engines. Serialize changes.
- External workstreams: SEC #59, realtime #53, home #44.
- Decisions: preserve current stack; no provider calls for audit; no SEC edits; no license expansion.
- Rollback: each isolated commit is revertible; no production migration/merge authorized by this run.

## Phase order and status
0. Audit/source contracts/architecture delta/parity — recorded; baseline PASS.
1a. Lifecycle checkpoint and corruption handling — NEXT; focused tests then compatibility gate.
1b. Registry and typed product contract — pending; no semantic aliases without tests.
2–3. Design foundations/navigation/search — pending; existing route parity mandatory.
4–6. Home/Markets/Discover/Stock — pending; rights-aware services first.
7–8. Professional workspaces/Screener — pending; preserve engine and rule definitions.
9–10. Signals/Realtime — pending; price semantics and entitlement gates.
11–13. Strategy/Portfolio/Atlas — pending; trust and source gates.
14–15. Visual/mobile/journeys/security/release readiness — pending.

## Standing blockers, not excuses to stop independent work
- Production persistence for 7.6 GB history not proven; do not activate daily backfill.
- Corporate-action historical reconciliation not proven.
- Full-universe public display/derived rights unknown; preserve existing Golden-Five scope.
- SEC scale gate100 fails in parallel; no VU2 dependency on its completion.
- No VU2 browser/mobile visual gate yet.

## Evidence policy
Use small phases/*.md packs. Targeted tests while implementing, broader regressions at meaningful gates. Never repeat provider/full-universe scale unless a changed contract requires it. Fetch before large phases and before PR readiness. Shared overlap invalidates plan and requires delta review. Record FAIL, missing evidence and unresolved parity honestly. Final status currently AUDIT_COMPLETE only after documentation review; not FOUNDATION_READY.
