#         assigned to the last CLOSED reporting period instead of the period
#         their cover date falls into; a standalone quarter is no longer
#         reconstructed from cumulative periods that are out of order.
#
# 1.2.0 — a cover-date instant no longer publishes its cover date as the cell's
#         period end. The end date comes from what the company itself reported
#         for the same fiscal period.
#
# 1.3.0 — a borrowed period end must not fall after the cover date. Version
#         1.2.0 shipped without that guard, and in the early years the fiscal
#         calendar cannot place unambiguously it borrowed a date a full year
#         later, so a filing appeared to know a balance sheet that had not
#         happened yet.
